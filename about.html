<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello and welcome to my page!</h2>
<p>I am Julian. After studying journalism, I decided to continue pushing buttons and redirected my professional career to the software world. Nowadays, I am a software developer with experience in web development. If you are here, it is because you are looking for a way to know something more about me.</p>
<p>Not everything in my life is coding and programming; I also do other things in my free time. I love motorcycles and anything that has an engine and wheels, although I probably prefer the wheels.</p>
<p>I enjoy riding my motorbike and even fixing it. As my bike is around 15 years old, I sometimes spend more time fixing it than riding it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I like riding bicycles because it's a great way to exercise. I believe it is the best transportation method, even when I was living in Ireland, where it rains every day.</p>
<p>So, if you are here, it's because you want to know more about me and have my contact information. Here are some links about my life and profession:</p>
